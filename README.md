Hi I'm Adam a 4th year theoretical physics student at the University of Manchester. 

I have been learning about machine learning and deep learning along side my degree and this repo contains some of my "from scratch"  scripts and jupyter notebooks.

My most recent project is an auto-differentiation library which is still in working progress. I am working with this library and PyTorch to improve my knowlegde of how neural networks can be trained efficiently.
